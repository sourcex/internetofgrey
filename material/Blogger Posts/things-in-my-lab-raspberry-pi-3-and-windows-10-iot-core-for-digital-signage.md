Recently, I wrote an [short post](http://nowmicro.com/blog/raspberry-pi-3-and-windows-10-iot-core-for-digital-signage) on using Windows 10 IoT Core on Raspberry Pi devices for Digital signage.  I wanted to detail a little bit more about what hardware I use for testing in the lab.  
  
I have a [SmartiPi Touch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3187) and Raspberry Pi setup in the home lab, which is really neat for giving demos and quickly testing stuff- as long as I don't need smooth video playback.  It is small and also shows what the UI looks like at a lower resolution  
  
Otherwise, I use our [Now Micro IoT Player 4k](http://nowmicroplayers.com/Embedded/MP%2FIoTPlayer), since I can quickly PXE boot it and reimage for greenfield testing.  Prior to that product release, I used a variety of Intel BayTrail based devices, depending on what I was trying to accomplish at the time.  
  
Overall, the IoT Player 4k is a lot faster and easier to work with when debugging UWP apps, but having a second monitor with me isn't always convenient.
