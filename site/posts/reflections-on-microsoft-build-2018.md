I had the pleasure to attend [Microsoft BUILD](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build/content) this year.  There's so much to see and do, it really is an assault on the senses.  Despite so much going on and all the [huge announcements](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/build-2018-microsoft-embraces-its-new-platforms-azure-and-microsoft-365/), I never feel like was missing anything because the sessions are recorded and freely available on the web.  The greater value is the ability to share videos of sessions I found particularly interesting with those that didn't have the opportunity or time to attend the conference.  
  
There was a lot of AI/ML on display, from Azure hosted, to things you could host on-box with Azure IoT Edge.  It will take a while to digest it all, but I overall love the idea that you can find a way to work with these new technologies on the platform, device and security/risk posture of your choosing.  
  
Some things I ran across:  
  

*   A neat [demo](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Samples-IntelligentKiosk) of Microsoft Cognitive Services
*   [Smart Mirror](https://github.com/richdizz/Microsoft-Smart-Mirror) (The author had an insightful [Microsoft Graph for IoT Devices](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2018/THR2430) demo)
*   [The Seven Properties of Highly Secure Devices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/seven-properties-highly-secure-devices/) 
*   [Windows IoT: Accelerate the Intelligent Edge with the Windows AI Platform : Build 201](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build/content/intelligent-edge-with-windows-ai)8\\
